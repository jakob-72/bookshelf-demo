# Bookshelf-Service

A simple RESTful microservice that allows users to manage their books.
This service is build with fiber and gorm. It features CRUD operations for books.

This service features the following endpoints:

- `GET /books`: Get all books for the requesting user
- `POST /books`: Create a new book
- `PUT /books/:id`: Update a book
- `DELETE /books/:id`: Delete a book

## Persistence

For demonstration purposes, the service uses a SQLite database.
The database is accessed through a Repository interface and via GORM, which makes it easy to switch to another database.
It could be easily replaced with a managed PostgreSQL or MySQL database in order to scale horizontally.

## Authentication

Each request to the API must include an `Authorization` header with a valid JWT token.
The token is generated by the auth-service and must be signed with the same secret key.

## Development

Run `make run` to start the service locally on port `8090`.

Run `make` or `make help` to see all available commands.

## About Deployment

This service is designed to be deployed as a microservice. It can be easily containerized.
The service is stateless and can be scaled horizontally once the SQLite database is replaced.
